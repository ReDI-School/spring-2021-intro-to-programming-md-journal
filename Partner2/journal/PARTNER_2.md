I will mark my tasks as done by adding inside the brackets [ ] a X 

like -> [X]

## Tasks! 

- [ ] Create a new git branch <username/test-branch `git checkout -b branch_name`
- [ ] Look for the file `github.md` and open it
  - [ ] Add under questions something that you found difficult
  - [ ] Save the file `Control/Command+s`

## Let's add the changes
- [ ] `git status`
- [ ] `git add all the changes`
- [ ] `git commit all your changes`
- [ ] `git push origin <current-branch>`
- [ ] open a Pull Request with your changes
- [ ] Approve it
- [ ] Merge it 

## Swap with your partner

Now it is time for your partner to repeat what you have done.

BUT! instead of forking the repository we will clone directly your partner repository so both of you can contribute towards a shared journal.

For that let´s do the following:

- Ask your partner for an URL pointing to his journal repository that both of you have created and existts in Github.
- ** Let´s clone the repository** (make sure the Pull Request opened is merged and that the main branch has the content you just created)
- Add some new files, folders, images and after add, commit and push your changes. You can go back to section 3 and repeat the same instructions
